# Our To-Do List

We wanted to create a to-do list that was quirky and playful in its design.

Users can create, edit, complete, and delete their lists with a few intuitive clicks. A counter keeps track of remaining tasks. A gentle reminder nudges the user to take action if the list starts to overflow.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Passport.js, EJS, CSS

Our mission? We set out to blend productivity with a touch of whimsy and a sprinkle of order in a full-stack web application.

The result? Thanks to MVC architecture, a meticulously organized codebase. Thanks to CSS, an inviting, quirky, and playful design.

Node.js and Express work in the background, hearing requests and serving up responses.
Passport.js greets users, ensuring they have an account to personalize their lists.
MongoDB serves as our database holding each user and their unique lists.
EJS swoops in for the adaptive logic we need to choreograph what's rendered on the screen.
