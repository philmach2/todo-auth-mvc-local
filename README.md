# Our To-Do List

A quirky, playful take on the classic to-do list — built to make productivity feel a little more fun and a little less like work.

Users can create, edit, complete, and delete tasks with just a few intuitive clicks.  
A counter keeps track of how many tasks are left, and if your list starts getting a bit *too long*, a gentle nudge encourages you to take action.
